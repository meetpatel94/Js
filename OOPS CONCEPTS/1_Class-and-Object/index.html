        <li>Objects in JavaScript are the most important data type and form the building blocks for modern JavaScript.</li><br>
    <li>Unlike primitive data types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined, and symbol), which hold a single value, objects can hold multiple values as properties. This makes objects incredibly useful for grouping related data and operations, leading to more organized and maintainable code.</li>
