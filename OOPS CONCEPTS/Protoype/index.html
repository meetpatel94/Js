    <ul>
        <li>
            In JavaScript, prototypes are a fundamental feature that allows for inheritance and sharing of properties and methods between objects.

        <li>
           <strong>How Prototypes Work:</strong>When you create a function in JavaScript, a special property called `prototype` is automatically created and assigned to that function. This `prototype` property itself is an object, and it's used when you create new instances of that function (if the function is used as a constructor).
        </li><br>
        <li>
          We can use Protype use <strong>_ _proto_ _</strong>
