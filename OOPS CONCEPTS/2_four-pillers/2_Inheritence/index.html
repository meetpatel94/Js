    <ul>
        <li>
            Inheritance is the mechanism by which a new class, called a derived (or child) class, is created from an existing class, called a base (or parent) class.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            The derived class inherits attributes and methods from the base class, allowing code reuse and creating a hierarchical relationship.
        </li><br>
    </ul>
